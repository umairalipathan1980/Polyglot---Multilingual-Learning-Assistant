## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **LangChain**: Large language model integration
- **OpenAI API**: GPT model for language tutoring
- **Python**: Core programming language

## Extending the Application

### Adding New Languages
To add support for new languages:
1. Add the language to the `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` dictionary in `app.py`
2. Add appropriate greetings to the `LANGUAGE_GREETINGS` dictionary
3. Add language-specific grammar features in `utils.py`
4. Add level-appropriate content for the language in `utils.py`

### Adding New Features
The modular architecture makes it easy to add new features:
1. UI components can be added to `app.py`
2. Language processing logic can be extended in `chatbot.py`
3. Utility functions can be added to `utils.py`

## Streamlit Secrets Management

The application uses Streamlit's built-in secrets management system instead of environment variables or .env files. Configuration is stored in the `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file:

```toml
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-openai-api-key"

# Optional - change model
MODEL_NAME = "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14"  # Default GPT model
```

In the application code, these secrets are accessed using:
```python
api_key = st.secrets.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", "")
model_name = st.secrets.get("MODEL_NAME", "gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14")
```

For local development, ensure your `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file is in the project root. For deployment on Streamlit Cloud, add these secrets in the app settings.

> **Important**: Never commit your secrets.toml file to version control. It is included in .gitignore by default.
